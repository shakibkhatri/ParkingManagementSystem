# smart-parking-app
Android application developed with kotlin to enable users view the occupancy status of parking lots in real-time. 
The occupancy data is obtained by the app from a Firebase realtime database, and updates every time there is a change in the database.
Linking the app to the Firebase database and reading the data has been implemented in the ViewLotOccupant.kt file.
